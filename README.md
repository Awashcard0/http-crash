# http-crash
**Do not copy from main directory**

What started it as a thing to pass the time in robotics class is now I think I actually care about which is rare.

 so I have made three different versions of it
 
 ## read me
 
 this was made to control the crashing in other games [Sketchboss](https://github.com/Awashcard0/Sketchboss) and [slope](https://github.com/Awashcard0/slope-test) it didn't end up working but I eventually revisited it when I was working on home thing for my website and i decided to fix it and now were here.

 ## Legacy

 Inside the legacy folder you'll find the original. This version read the file hosted on the web server (Cloudflare pages) that I had it set up on. It rather the file on the web server and not from the repo because it would view from the cache or somthing

 ## Current

 The current version can be controlled by a node js web server. The current version also has a feature where you can show an alert before crashing. This can be ran on a normal web server or can be ran on replit i'll show both

 ### Replit

 Replit is pretty simple

 1. Click on [this link](https://replit.com/@Awashcard0/Crash-controle) and fork the repl
 2. In replit click on secrets > create new secret > name is PASS all uppercase > in value put whatever you want the password to be > save
 3. Then enter your repls URL into the URL variable on the web page

 ### non replit / web-server

 By the point that you're putting this on a web server you should probably know what to do. If you don't just enter the URL to wherever this is configured. Download it from the web server folder
