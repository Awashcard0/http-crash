# http-crash
What started it as a thing to pass the time in robotics class is now I think I actually care about which is rare.

 so I have made three different versions of it
 
 ## read me
 
 this was made to control the crashing in other games [Sketchboss](https://github.com/Awashcard0/Sketchboss) and [slope](https://github.com/Awashcard0/slope-test) it didn't end up working but I eventually revisited it when I was working on home thing for my website and i decided to fix it and now were here
